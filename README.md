# gifduration.py

This script takes one or more animated GIF files as input and calculates their
total durations, returning zero for non-animated GIF files.


## Requirements

* [Pillow](https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow)

Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, preferably outside a virtual environment if you want this script available system-wide.

## Installation

Clone the repository to some appropriate folder and symlink `gifduration.py` into your PATH, for example:

    ln -s ~/Code/gifduration/gifduration.py /usr/local/bin/gifduration

You may also have to make it executable:

    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gifduration


## Usage

To get the duration of an animated GIF file, supply it as an argument:

    gifduration atom-heart-mother.gif

This will return something like:

    atom-heart-mother.gif:
    Total duration: 2000 ms (2.00 seconds)
    ---

To also get the duration of each frame, use the `--verbose` (or `-v`) flag:

    gifduration --verbose atom-heart-mother.gif

This will return something like:

    atom-heart-mother.gif:
    Frame 1: 30 ms (0.03 seconds)
    Frame 2: 80 ms (0.08 seconds)
    Frame 3: 30 ms (0.03 seconds)
    [â€¦]
    Total duration: 2000 ms (2.00 seconds)
    ---

You can get the durations of several animated GIF files at once just by supplying all of them as arguments, for example:

    gifduration atom-heart-mother.gif meddle.gif a-saucerful-of-secrets.gif

This will return something like:

    atom-heart-mother.gif:
    Total duration: 2000 ms (2.00 seconds)
    ---
    meddle.gif:
    Total duration: 100 ms (0.10 seconds)
    ---
    a-saucerful-of-secrets.gif:
    Total duration: 0 ms (0.00 seconds)
    ---

GIF files that are not animated will return a duration of zero. All other file types will return the message `Not a GIF image`.
